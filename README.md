# ComputerArchitectureLab3
The objective of this lab is to be familiar with the McPAT simulator that produces results about the consuming power of a program


### Dynamic Power
Circuits dissipate dynamic power when they
charge and discharge the capacitive loads to switch states.
Dynamic power is proportional to the total load capacitance,
the supply voltage, the voltage swing during switching, the
clock frequency, and the activity factor.

### Dynamic Leakage
Transistors in circuits leak, dissipating static power. Leakage
current depends on the width of the transistors and the
local state of the devices. There are two leakage mechanisms.
Subthreshold leakage occurs because a small current
passes between the source and drain of off-state transistors.
Gate leakage is the current leaking through the gate terminal,
and varies greatly with the state of the device.
